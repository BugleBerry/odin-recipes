  <h2 class="title lime">Description</h2>
    <p>It's been called the greatest regional American dessert</p>
    <p>Key lime pie is a custard pie from Florida. It was originally not baked at all, but we're gonna bake this one.</p>

  <h2 class="title lime">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3 class="title">For the Crust</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>150-200g graham crackers</li>
            <li>1/2-1 stick (2-4 oz, 57-114g) butter, melted (or 60-120 ml coconut oil for a vegan pie)</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 teaspoon (3-6g) salt, if using unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3-1/2 cup (66-100g) sugar, I like brown sugar (white sugar + molasses)</li>
            <li>ground cinnamon to taste (maybe half a teaspoon, very optional)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="title">For the Custard</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>3/4-1 cup (177-237 ml) lime juice</li>
            <li>The zest of 2-4 limes (very optional)</li>
            <li>5-6 egg yolks (or 1/2 cup, 118 ml vegan sour cream)</li>
            <li>28 oz (3.5 cups, 830 ml) sweetened condensed milk (to make vegan version, combine 4 standard 13.5 oz, 400 ml cans of coconut milk and 1 1/3 cups, 230g sugar in a saucepan and simmer for about 45 min, stirring frequently — you might not need all of it, depends on how much it reduces)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="title">For the Topping</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1-2 cups (236-473 ml) whipping cream</li>
            <li>sugar (ideally powdered sugar) to taste</li>
            <li>vanilla extract to taste</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="title lime">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pulverize the graham crackers as fine as you want them. Mix in a conservative amount of sugar, salt (if using unsalted butter), cinnamon (if using) and melted butter. The less butter, the more crumbly the finished crust will be. Taste and consider adding more sugar, salt or butter. Mold into a 9-10 inch (23-25 cm) pie pan, tamping it down smooth. Bake empty at 325 F (160 C) convection or 250 F (180 C) conventional for 10 minutes. Let it cool throughly before filling it.</li>
      <li>Make the filling by mixing together the sweetened condensed milk, egg yolks and limes juice. If you don't want the pie very acidic, go with the smaller quantity of juice, and use only five egg yolks instead of six. You could mix in some of the lime zest now and reserve some for garnish later, put it all in now, or put none of it in now.</li>
      <li><p>Pour the filling into the crust — it should look like not quite enough, because custard expands slightly when cooked. Bake at the same temperature as before for 20-30 min, or until the center of the pie has firmed slightly, but is still wobbly when you nudge the pan. Don't let anything brown.</p>
        <p>NOTE! If you're doing the version with sour cream [vegan or otherwise] instead of egg yolks, it won't need to bake nearly as long. I'd guess 10 minutes, max, until you see little bubbles bursting at the surface. It won't seem very set, but it'll set up in the fridge.</p></li>
      <li>Cool thoroughly on the counter before chilling overnight.</li>
      <li>Whip the cream and flavor it with as much sugar and vanilla as tastes good to you. Serve the chilled pie with some whipped cream on top, and maybe garnish with fresh lime zest.</li>
    </ol>
